### Other Relevant Experiences and Studies
```
Software Engineer Internship at Digicom plc. Italy. 
Among my tasks, I was tasked to debug the main on-platform software for the flag-ship VoIP router-like device. After assessing the beta version code, I ended up rewriting the entire application from scratch utilizing the OOD. The result was a much more functional and linear back-end package with none-to-zero latency.

Currently Undertaking the CS50 online version.
CS50x covers a comprehensive introduction to computer science and programming. It includes fundamental concepts such as problem-solving, algorithms, and programming languages. It provides a strong foundation for further learning and application in diverse technical roles
